## Services

The project consists of the following microservices:

1. **Users Service**: User management (create, read, update, delete)
2. **Posts Service**: Post management (create, read, delete, list)
3. **Comments Service**: Comment management (create, read, delete, list)
4. **Web Service**: REST API that uses all other services

## Web Interface (Static UI)

This branch includes a minimalist static web interface for the blog, located in `web/static/`:

- `index.html`: Main feed, create posts, view posts and comments
- `login.html`: User login page
- `signup.html`: User registration page
- `profile.html`: User profile, posts, and comments

You do not need to run a separate static file server. When you run the web service (`web/main.go`), it will serve both the REST API and the web interface (static files) on http://localhost:42096.

Just start the web service as shown below, then open http://localhost:42096 in your browser to use the app.

Authentication and profile features are available via the UI. The static UI interacts with the REST API provided by the web service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or higher
- [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) v5 (master branch)

To install Micro CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/micro/micro/v5@master
```

Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your `PATH` so you can use the `micro` command.

### Launching Services

You have two options to run all services:

**Option 1: Use Micro CLI**

If you have [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) installed, you can run all services at once from the project root:

```bash
micro run --all
```

**Option 2: Use the Makefile (no Micro required)**

You can use the Makefile to run all services in parallel using plain Go:

```bash
make run-all
```

Or run individual services:

```bash
make run-users
make run-posts
make run-comments
make run-web
```

The REST API and web interface will be available at http://localhost:42096
